    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Skillet potatoes are an easy-to-make dish that can be served with a variety of side dishes.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound medium red or Yukon Gold potatoes (3 to 4)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter (optional)</li>
        <li>Finely chopped fresh herbs</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Quarter 1 pound red or Yukon gold potatoes lengthwise, then cut each piece crosswise into 1-inch wide chunks. 
            Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a 10 to 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering. 
            (Alternatively, use a nonstick skillet and 1 1/2 tablespoons oil.) 
            Add the potatoes, arrange in a single layer cut-side down, and season with 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Cover with a tightfitting lid and cook undisturbed until the potatoes are tender and the bottoms are golden brown, about 20 minutes. 
            Meanwhile, finely chop the herb of your choice, 1 teaspoon thyme or oregano, or 1/2 teaspoon rosemary.</li>
        <li>Uncover and flip each piece with tongs to a second cut side. Season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and a few grinds of black pepper. 
            Increase the heat to medium high and cook uncovered until the second side is golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes more, moving the pieces around as needed so they brown evenly.</li>
        <li>Add the herb and 1 tablespoon unsalted butter if desired and cook, tossing occasionally, until the butter is melted and the herbs are fragrant, about 1 minute. 
            Taste and season with more salt as needed.</li>
    </ol>
